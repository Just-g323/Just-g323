# Heyo, I’m g323

**Student • Developer • Video Editor**

I build things, learn fast, and finish what I start.
Currently exploring the space between **logic, data, and creative tools**.

## What I’m About

* I learn quickly and document what I discover
* I don’t like unfinished work — I iterate until it works
* I enjoy solving problems that require both structure *and* imagination

---

## Current Focus

* Expanding real-world coding projects
* Moving local projects onto GitHub
* Building a portfolio that reflects both technical and creative work

---

## Beyond Code

Before focusing fully on tech, I built experience in environments that required discipline, responsibility, and focus.

- Ran a small car-flipping business during COVID, handling sourcing, pricing, and resale  
- Competed in horse riding at national level  
- Practice archery — I enjoy precision and patience-based skills  
- Certified diver (PADI)  
- CPR certified by the Saudi Heart Association  

These experiences shaped how I approach projects: stay calm, stay consistent, and finish properly.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Publish my strongest local projects
* [ ] Build one polished flagship project
* [ ] Contribute to an open-source project
* [ ] Document my learning journey publicly
